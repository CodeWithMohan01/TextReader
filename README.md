# Text-to-Speech Application

This simple Text-to-speech (TTS) application was created using Python's tkinter and pyttsx3 libraries. It allows users to enter text in a text area, select the voice gender and speech speed, and then either listen to the spoken text or save it as an audio file.

## Features

- User-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) using tkinter.
- Choose between male and female voices.
- Adjust the speech speed to fast, normal, or slow.
- Listen to the text using the "Speak" button.
- Save the spoken text as an audio file using the "Save" button.

3. Install the required Python libraries if you haven't already:
